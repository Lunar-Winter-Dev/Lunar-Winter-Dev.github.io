The index.html in the root directory is the "start-point".

To add new html files made to be viewed as a website, add a folder and then insert an index.html. Folders can be nested (i.e. https://lunarwinterdev.github.io/team/[username]/)
All HTML files intended to be used in <object> tags go into /templates/html/[name of template]/
All CSS and JS files intended for template use go with the template (in templates/html/[name of template])
All other CSS and JS files intended for use with <link> or <script> go into templates/(css or js)/[name of file]
All images or other assets (aside from favicon.ico) go in assets/
