The index.html in the root directory is the "start-point".

To add new html files made to be viewed as a website, add a folder and then insert an index.html. Folders can be nested (i.e. https://lunarwinterdev.github.io/team/[username]/)
All other HTML, CSS, and JS files intended for template use in (all under same name) (in templates/(html or css or js)/[name of template])
All images or other assets (aside from favicon.ico) go in assets/
